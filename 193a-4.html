    <p><strong>HAL/S</strong> (High-order Assembly Language/Shuttle) is a real-time aerospace programming language compiler and cross-compiler for avionics applications used by <strong>NASA</strong> and associated agencies (JPL, etc.). It has been used in many U.S. space projects since 1973 and its most significant use was in the <strong>Space Shuttle program</strong> (approximately <strong>85%</strong> of the Shuttle software was coded in HAL/S). It was designed by Intermetrics in 1972 for NASA and delivered in 1973. HAL/S is written in XPL, a dialect of PL/I. Although HAL/S is designed primarily for programming on-board computers, it is general enough to meet nearly all the needs in the production, verification, and support of aerospace and other real-time applications. According to documentation from 2005, it was being maintained by the HAL/S project of United Space Alliance.</p>
