        <h4>Rowland's Adventure</h4>
        <p>This was my entry for a 2 day game jam about controlling gravity, mostly inspired by Super Mario Galaxy. The gravity effect was accomplished by detecting planets with large triggers, and then determining the direction of gravity with a specialized function that accounts for the player's relative position and the shape of the planet. I wanted to avoid the raycast method, as it has proven itself quite janky in the past. I modelled the character myself in Blender and animated it procedurally in C#. This way my first attempt at designing a level with a silent tutorial and a gradual difficulty progression. Playtests showed it wasn't quite effective, and unfortunately I ran out of time to fix it. I learned that if you wish to communicate to the player without words, you must use precise colors and symbols as your language instead.</p>

        <h4>Soft Reminder</h4>
        <p>I needed a periodic, soft and silent reminder for therapy work, but I could not find any apps that allowed this, so I made one myself! This is a simple Android app that runs a custom vibration pattern at a user defined rate. An app must have a foreground process to use the vibration motor, so I had to start up a foreground service from the background repeatedly. I used Android's Alarm Scheduler API, since precise timing was important to me. This approach is suprisingly kind to battery life, probably because my foreground service is so simple. The UI was made in Jetpack Compose, which might be the best UI framework ever concieved I love it.</p>

        <h4>Wooden Croaks Bookstore</h4>
        <p>This game was a group project was a fantastical take on the game Unpacking, where you run a bookstore in a magic forest. I ended up doing a lot of work on the project. I programmed the holding and placing prop mechanics, which work by defining a grid in world space, and snapping objects to that grid based on how many squares their footprint occupies. I made an outline shader effect, which is a Scriptable Renderer Feature in Unity's URP that renders all the object silhouettes to a render texture with a different color. It then runs an edge detection pass over the color, depth, and normal buffers to detect edges, and blits the black outline pixels back to the camera's color buffer. It looks good but is finicky to calibrate, and I have since moved on to outline effects with manually defined edges. I also made grass that uses GPU instancing to draw a large number of blades at very high speeds, and then animate each blade in a vertex shader that offsets the blade tips depending on a wind texture that I generate procedurally in a compute shader. </p>

        <h4>Senior Project</h4>
        <p>My senior project team is developing a custom dashboard display and onboard computer for the Engineering Department's experimental electric offroad racecar. It uses a Linux box that is running a custom OpenGL UI on a touch display, as well as logging telemetry from all the sensors on the vehicle. I am working on developing the backend, which manages all the running processes and facilitates data transfer between them. I have written scripts to create synthetic data streams to test logging, take live incoming data and write it to a CSV file, and recover files that may be corrupted if the system's power is unexpectedly cut.</p>

        <p>This is the first finished game of the Video Game Design Club at my University! My role in the project was primarily to teach other members how to program in Unity, since I was one of the most experienced people in the club. I taught C#, the basics of Unity's framework, physics programming, state machines, and importing 2D assets. I did make some contributions fixing bugs, hooking up the UI, and making some of the sprites, but I was mostly focused on coaching. For being a lot of people's first ever game, I think it came out really well!</p>

        <h4>Wifi Website</h4>
        <p>My first university project was to make a website with a group, so we made one that monitors the wifi traffic of some popular campus buildings and estimates how good the signal will be. The goal was to help students find a good place to study. I made an Android App for it that used a REST API to pull data from the server, and then make helpful visualizations of that data for the user. This was my first serious Android development project, and I learned a lot about project structure and code organization as well as the Android framework itself.</p>

    <div id="solitaire" class="uk-margin uk-card uk-card-secondary uk-card-body ">
        <h4>Serial Solitaire</h4>
        <p>This was a last minute entry into a game jam with a cozy autumn theme. Since I had so little time, I decided to make my own solitaire variant! Technically it is very simple, just screen raycasts and object parenting. My inspiration for the design came from my frustration of dealing the King cards in normal solitaire. They don't stack with anything, so they can only be moved if there is an empty slot. I removed the King and just required each stack to have 2 Queens, and Queens can stack on top of each other. I also tried something new by adding a stack to the side that can hold 5 cards, but they can only be retrieved in the order they were put in. I'm very happy with how the design plays, it feels difficult but not too difficult, and the stack forces some fun strategy! Everytime I open it up again I get sucked in for an hour. I made the card designs as well as the board background myself, just using tileable textures and an image editor, and I think it looks quite good! This game taught me that it is much easier to make an actually good game when you manage scope properly.</p>

        <h4>3D Artwork Showcase</h4>
        <p>I have been making 3D models for almost as long as I've been making games, but I only recently took the plunge and learned proper modelling techniques and topolgy. I thought I would put together some of my better models into a card here! In these projects I use modifiers (subdivision surface, solidify, project, mirror, etc.), UVs, Shader Nodes, Sculpting, Rigging, Volumes, Particle Systems, Curves, and more! I'm finally getting to the point where I feel I have enough knowledge to make anything I can think of. There is still much to learn and improve, and I'm excited to continue making 3D artwork in the future!</p>

        <h4>Desert Bus 3D</h4>
        <p>I used to have a friend a while ago who loved the Desert Bus Charity Marathon, so I made a 3d version of the game for him! It has a fully procedural terrain system based on heightmaps. It generates heightmap textures with a few octaves of Perlin Noise. The system also uses chunks with varying levels of detail to make far render distances possible! The terrain textures are just triplanar mapped in a shader. This project taught me so much, it is where my skills in many advanced game development topics began.</p>

        <h4>Unity Graphing Library</h4>
        <p>Recently I wanted to make some 3D charts. I looked for a good free asset in Unity to do this, but I couldn't find any, so I just made my own! It can take in a csv file, parse it, and then display the results with many options to the user. Drag and Zoom are also both supported. Each data point is converted into a position within the chart's volume in a compute shader, and rendered as a 3D sphere with GPU instancing. I had over 20 charts, each with hundreds or thousands of points being rendered, and still had no performance issues. I am very proud of how this ended up coming out!</p>

        <h4>3D Game of Life</h4>
        <p>This was one of my very first Unity projects! It allows you to build and save any initial conditions for a simulation you like. You can also change the rules for the simulation along the top (Green for create, Yellow for Survive, Red for Death) for any number of neighbors. In addition to teaching me the basics of Unity, I also learned how to serialize data, write it to disk, and read it back later. </p>

<h3 class="uk-margin-xlarge-left uk-light">About Me</h3>
<p class="uk-margin-xlarge-left uk-margin-xlarge-right">My name is Roxanne, but I go by Roxy. I am an aspiring developer and game designer! Creativity has been a strong driving force my entire life, I have been making things since I was a child. I taught myself programming to make a small Unity game when I was in middle school, and I have been coding ever since. I have worked on many projects of many types since then, and I've learned something from each. This has given me years of experience problem solving and coding. Many times I worked with others, and I learned how to effectively communicate and work as a team. I am currently a senior at the University of California Sacramento, and will be graduating May 2024. <br> <br> I have learned many technical skills, both in school and on my own. I am a proficient programmer in C, C++, C#, Java, and Phython, with some knowledge of JS and Kotlin. I am familiar with common data structures and some strategies for code organization. Most of my experience is in the Unity game engine, but I know the basics of Unreal Engine and Godot. I know how to interact with with Unity's Physics, UI, Sound, and Rendering Systems/Pipelines. I have also used Android Studio, Intellij, VS Code, and Rider. I can write shaders in HLSL and GLSL. I'm familiar with many shader types, realtime VFX techniques, and the basics of GPU architecture. I can also write compute shaders. For 3D artwork, I use Blender and a bit of Substance Painter. I'm familiar with modelling for low-poly and subdivision surface workflows. I know UV Wrapping, Materials, Shader Nodes, and Lighting as well. I am always eager to learn more about advanced programming techniques on both the CPU and GPU!</p>
