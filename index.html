        <h4>Rowland's Adventure</h4>
        <p>This was a much-to-ambitious 3D Platformer with a gravity gimmick for a 3 day game jam. Despite this, I still managed to finish a cute little demo before the deadline, and its fun! The character controller, gravity system, character model, and levels were all done by me from scratch. I learned a lot about level design and how to communicate silently with the player, as well as how to prototype levels quickly.</p>

        <h4>Soft Reminder</h4>
        <p>I needed a periodic, soft and silent reminder for therapy work, but I could not find any apps that allowed this, so I did it myself! This is a simple Android app that runs a custom vibration pattern at a user set rate. Unfortunately I cannot publish it on the Play Store because it needs to constantly set alarms to start foreground services in order to function. It works reliably and has helped me quite a bit! This project taught me Kotlin basics, the Android Process Lifecycle, and the Jetpack Compose UI Framework.</p>

        <h4>Wooden Croaks Bookstore</h4>
        <p>This was a group project with other developers I met in a discord. The idea was you ran a magical bookstore with gameplay similar to the game Unpacking. I coded the placement grid, holding and moving objects, a menu system, a dialogue system, a game sequencing system, and the audio system, while also doing the graphics programming for the grass & outline effects. I also made all the temporary props used in the demo. Unfortunately, my team members we unable to contribute much themselves, and the project eventually died. Honestly I'm still sad about it, I put in so much work and had so much passion for this game. At least I still learned a lot about Compute Shaders and Unity's new Universal Render Pipeline along the way, and I'm incredibly proud of what I was able to make for it.</p>

        <h4>Senior Project</h4>
        <p>We are developing a custom dashboard display and onboard computer for the Engineering Department's experimental electric offroad racecar. It uses a Linux box that is running a custom OpenGL UI on a touch display, as well as logging telemetry from all the sensors on the vehicle. I am on the team developing the backend, which manages processes and state. I have written scripts to create synthetic data streams to test logging, as well as some of the logging logic itself.</p>

        <p>This is the first finished game of the Video Game Design Club at my University! I was less involved, as I was on the other team, but I helped some programmers on this project learn Unity. When my team fell apart, I joined this project and helped fix bugs and add polish in the last weeks. Some of my art from the dead project was also recycled into this one! This game turned out so well considering it was many people's first ever game!</p>

        <h4>Wifi Website</h4>
        <p>My first university project was to make a website with a group, so we made one that monitors the wifi traffic of some popular campus buildings and estimates how good the signal will be. The goal was to help students find a good place to study. I made an Android App for it that used a REST API to pull data from the server, and then make helpful visualizations of that data for the user. This was my first serious Android development project, and I learned a lot about project structure and code organization as well as the Android framework itself.</p>

        <h4>Serial Solitaire</h4>
        <p>I joined a game jam with a group, but the project fell apart a few days before the deadline. I was so dejected that this happened yet again, and decided to make my own entry for the jam in the last few days. This is the result! I made some of my own tweaks to classic solitaire that I think make the game more fun and interesting, and it turned out amazing! I did all of the Art and Programming by myself, and a friend captured the background for me.</p>

        <h4>Unity Graphing Library</h4>
        <p>Recently I wanted to make some 3D charts. I looked for a good free asset in Unity to do this, but I couldn't find any, so I just made my own! It can take in a csv file, parse it, and then display the results with many options to the user. Drag and Zoom are also both supported. Each data point is converted into a position within the chart's volume in a compute shader, and rendered as a 3D sphere with GPU instancing. I had over 20 charts, each with hundreds or thousands of points being rendered, and still had no performance issues. This was a niche one but I still think its cool.</p>

<h3 class="uk-margin-xlarge-left uk-light">About Me</h3>
<p class="uk-margin-xlarge-left uk-margin-xlarge-right">My name is Roxanne, but I go by Roxy. I am an aspiring developer and game designer! Creativity has been a strong driving force my entire life, I have been making things since I was a child. I taught myself programming to make a small Unity game when I was in middle school, and I have been coding ever since. I have worked on many projects of many types since then, and I've learned something from each. This has given me years of experience problem solving and coding. Many times I worked with others, and I learned how to effectively communicate and work as a team. I am currently a senior at the University of California Sacramento, and will be graduating this May. <br> <br> I have learned many technical skills, both in school and on my own. I am a proficient programmer in C, C++, C#, Java, and Phython, with some knowledge of JS and Kotlin. I am familiar with common data structures and some strategies for code organization. Most of my experience is in the Unity game engine, but I know the basics of Unreal Engine and Godot. I know how to interact with with Unity's Physics, UI, Sound, and Rendering Systems/Pipelines. I have also used Android Studio, Intellij, VS Code, and Rider. I can write shaders in HLSL and GLSL. I'm familiar with many shader types, realtime VFX techniques, and the basics of GPU architecture. I can also write compute shaders. For 3D artwork, I use Blender and a bit of Substance Painter. I'm familiar with modelling for low-poly and subdivision surface workflows. I know UV Wrapping, Materials, Shader Nodes, and Lighting as well. I am always eager to learn more about advanced programming techniques on both the CPU and GPU!</p>
